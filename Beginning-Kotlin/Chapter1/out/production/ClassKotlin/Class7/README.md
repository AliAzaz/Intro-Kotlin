##Practice Time: Lambdas

Create a lambda and assign it to rollDice, which returns a dice roll (number between 1 and 12).

Extend the lambda to take an argument indicating the number of sides of the dice used for the roll.

If you haven't done so, fix the lambda to return 0 if the number of sides passed in is 0.

Create a new variable, rollDice2, for this same lambda using the function type notation.


##Practice Time: Extra Questions
Why would you want to use the function type notation instead of just the lambda?

Create a function gamePlay() that takes a roll of the dice as an argument and prints it out.

Pass your rollDice3 function as an argument to gamePlay() to generate a dice roll every time gamePlay() is called.

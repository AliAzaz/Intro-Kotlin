## Improve your whatShouldIDoToday() program
 with the new knowledge from this segment.

Add 3 more situations and activities. 
For example:

````
mood == "sad" && weather == "rainy" && temperature == 0 -> "stay in bed"
temperature > 35 -> "go swimming"
````

Create a single-expression function for each condition and then use it in your when expression.
Challenge
Instead of passing in the mood, get a mood string from the user.

#### Hint: The !! operator may come handy.
